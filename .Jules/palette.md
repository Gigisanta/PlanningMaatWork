## 2026-03-04 - ARIA labels in Spanish for localized apps
**Learning:** Found multiple icon-only buttons (like Trash, Lock/Unlock, Close X) missing ARIA labels in `PortfolioEditor.tsx`. Since the app's UI is strictly localized in Spanish, the standard ARIA labels also need to be translated.
**Action:** Always provide translated `aria-label` attributes for icon-only buttons (e.g., "Eliminar documento" instead of "Delete document") matching the app's primary language.
